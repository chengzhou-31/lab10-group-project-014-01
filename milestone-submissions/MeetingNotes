Who:
 Diego is doing login.

Dan is doing register

Matthew is going to be helping create dummy data for the databases, and which ticketmaster API we want to use.

Liam: to take up how the website is going to look like, and how navigation is going to work. Create possibly a skeleton page

Cheng could help make the database, or someone else could also jump on that.

Need to have assignees to every storyboard.
