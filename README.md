## Application Details 
- App Name: **QuickTix**
- Description: Provides a platform which allows individuals to resell their tickets for events to which they cannot attend. Enables registered users to view sellers who are offering tickets, purchase tickets of interest, as well as sell their own tickets. The website will also support a review system which will ensure that scalpers and scammers are flagged.


- Vision Statement: For students who want affordable tickets, **QuickTix** connects those who cannot attend events to recuperate their losses and, in the process, provide an opportunity for others to attend their favorite events. Unlike **Ticketmaster**, **QuickTix** allows you to connect directly to the seller and builds a sense of community through the promotion of person to person transactions.


- Communication Plan: Our team will maintain communication primarily through the use of Discord. Our alternative form of communication will be by cellphone.
